Day 5: 4bit Binary to Gray conversion

Day 6: 4bit Gray to Binary conversion

Day 7: BCD to Excess3 Conversion

Day 8: BCD to Binary Conversion

Day 9: Binary to BCD Conversion

Day 10: Half Adder (by using all Modelling)

Day 11: Half Subtractor (by using all Modelling)

Day 12: Full Adder (by using all Modelling)

Day 13: Full Subtractor (by using all Modelling)

Day 14: Full Adder using Half Adder

Day 15: Full Subtractor using Half Subtractor

Day 16: Parallel Adder

Day 17: Ripple carry Adder / subtractor
